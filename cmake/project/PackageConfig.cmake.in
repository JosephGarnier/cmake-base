# What Is This?
# -------------
# In this file, you provide dependency information of your project for CMake
# based buildsystems for `find_package()` function. To know how to fill this
# file, please see cmake documentation of `find_package()`
# (https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html),
# cmake-packages (https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-packages.7.html)
# and cmake-buildsystem (https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-developer.7.html). But the file is already filled with a default content to be exported then imported in an other project with `target_link_libraries()`. If you are not familiar with these concepts of modern cmake, watch this tutorial: https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/doc/tutorials/Exporting-and-Importing-Targets.
