## Project structure
This project has been set up with a specific file/folder structure in mind. The following describes some important features of this setup:
  - `assets/`: Contains images, musics, maps and all resources needed for a simulation or a game project.
  - `bin/`: The output executables go here, both for the app and for any tests and spikes.
  - `build/`: Contains all object files, and is removed on a `clean`.
  - `cmake/modules/`: Contains `CMake` modules.
  - `cmake/project/Dependencies.cmake`: List of dependencies and automated build, triggered if dependency cannot be found locally.
  - `cmake/project/ProjectFiles.cmake`: List of project source files to build.
  - `cmake/toolchains/`: Contains toolchain file for your compiler. Call it in using CMake option `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`. By default, only one is proposed for Linux Clang.
  - `config/`: Contains configuration files.
  - `doc/`: Contains code documentation generated by [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org "Doxygen homepage")
  - `include/`: All project header files (.h). All necessary third-party header files that do not exist under `/usr/local/include` are also placed here.
  - `lib/`: Any libs that get compiled by the project, third party or any needed in development. Prior to deployment, third party libraries get moved to `/usr/local/lib` where they belong, leaving the project clean enough to compile on our Linux deployment servers.
  - `resources/`: Contains images, musics, maps and all resources needed if for your project.
  - `src/`: Project source files (*.cpp), including `main.cpp`, which contains example main-function for project build.
  - `tests/`: Project test source files (*.cpp) that are provided to the selecting unit testing framework.
  - `cmake-project.bat`: Utility script for Windows to execute `cmake` command. It is strongly recommanded to use it, otherwise take note what you must to do by refering to [Build options](https://github.com/JosephGarnier/cmake-base-cpp/blob/master/README.md#build-options).
  - `cmake-project.sh`: Utility script for Linux to execute `cmake` command. It is strongly recommanded to use it, otherwise take note what you must to do by refering to [Build options](https://github.com/JosephGarnier/cmake-base-cpp/blob/master/README.md#build-options).
  - `CMakeLists.txt`: main `CMakelists.txt` file for project (should not need to be modified for build).
  - `Doxyfile.in`: [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org "Doxygen homepage") configuration file, adapted for generic use within project build (should not need to be modified)
  - `LICENSE`: License file for project (copyright statement needs to be edited)
  - `README.md`: Readme file for project (copyright statement needs to be edited)
  - `Uninstall.cmake.in`: Uninstall configuration scrip, necessary for the `make uninstall` target.
